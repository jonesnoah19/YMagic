# YMagic

A project I made to showcase a handful of skills:

File I/O

Using a REST-like API

Error Handling

Working with JSON

Working with XML

Regular Expressions

Aggregating & Analysis

Simple and Dynamic Plotting in Matplotlib

Import a saved deck from Magic Arena, Magic the Gathering Online, or text-based deck lists. Parse decklist from various formats. Uses the Scryfall api to fetch card information. The stats() function will calculate the deck's mana curve, color count, and plot the results using matplotlib.


The YMagic folder contains 2 deck lists to test with, and screenshots of their results.
