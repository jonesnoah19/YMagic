# YMagic
A short tool for analyzing a Magic the Gathering decklist.

Import a saved deck from Magic Arena, Magic the Gathering Online, or text-based deck lists. Parse decklist from various formats. Uses the Scryfall api (https://scryfall.com/docs/api/) to fetch card information. The stats() function will calculate the deck's mana curve, color count, and plot the results using matplotlib.

The YMagic folder contains 2 deck lists to test with, and screenshots of their results.
